## What's a Uses Page?

A /uses page lists a developer's setup, gear, software, and configs (what they use). It's a great reference for those looking to add to their library of tools or reconfigure ones they already use.

## Editor

* [Visual Studio Code!](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    <p>I used SublimeText for years.  I switched (in early 2018?) for the ease of installing plugins, built in terminal and Git, awesome community, and massive momentum VS Code has gained.</p>
    
### VS Code themes

   I switch back n forth between a couple different themes.

   * [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2)
  * [Level Up Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=leveluptutorials.theme-levelup)

## Terminal

* VS Code built in Terminal
* [Hyper terminal](https://hyper.is/)
  Switched from iTerm2 around the time I changed to VS Code
* [FISH the Friendly Interactive SHell](https://fishshell.com/) I was using ZShell with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) for its close relationship to BASH.  With the rise of Serverless I don't feel the need to be closely tied to BASH
  * [Oh My FISH!](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) - adds some niceties to FISH

## Hosting

 * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Coming from Digital Ocean Netlify feels like the next evolution in hosting! ‚ù§Ô∏è the simple continuous integration with your Github!! It was interesting learning how to set up a server with D.O. There is so much new Front End Tech it is nice not to have to spend time on Dev Ops ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I created a theme called Cobalt2 for VS Code, Sublime Text and iTerm2 v3 which I use.
I‚Äôm currently using Operator Mono for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Before that I used Inconsolata for many years.
I use Operator Mono in VS Code and Hyper Term
I‚Äôm currently switching between Firefox Developer and Chrome Canary as my main browser
The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work ‚Äì my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
I currently use Hyper for my terminal, but many of my videos show me using iTerm2.
For Sublime Text, The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called JavaScript Completions ‚Äì you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions. For VS Code, there are no plugins needed to get this.
You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my Dot Files repo but please don‚Äôt just take these settings carte blanche ‚Äì they work for me but might not be the best
Desktop Apps
I use Text Expander for canned responses and for most of my code snippets
I‚Äôm a huge Alfred fan and have many workflows.
I use Things App with a GTD mindset for managing my tasks.
I design almost entirely in Sketch
I backup with 2 time machines local HDDs, Dropbox for most files, and BackBlaze for my entire hard drive.
The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is Rocket
Recording
I use ScreenFlow to record and edit my screencasts
I wrote about my animated gif workflow here
My mic is a Heil PR40 on a PL2T boom arm. Many of my videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing AT2020
I use a DBX286s to do almost all my audio compression and processing as a I record and pipe it into my computer with a Focusrite 2i2
My webcam is a Logitech HD Pro c920
All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an Anker 7/3 port USB 3.0 hub DIED üòµ Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable.
Desk Setup
My main monitor is a 32‚Ä≥ 4k LG 32ud59
To my right I run a vertical 27‚Ä≥ 4k Dell 4k P2715Q and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a Rain mStand
I sit on a polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron
My desk is an 8 foot oak butcher block countertop on legs
Here is a photo of my setup
Everything ‚Äî Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power ‚Äî is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my Caldigit TS3 Plus ‚Äì This is a pretty sweet setup!
I currently use a 2019 16‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32gb memory
My last laptop was a 2017 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro 3.1GHz i7 with 16gb memory
Other Gear
After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L and it‚Äôs incredible (and very expensive üòë).
