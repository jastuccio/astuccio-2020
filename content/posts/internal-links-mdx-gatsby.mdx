>The Gatsby `<Link />` component is for linking between pages within your site. For external links to pages not handled by your Gatsby site, use the regular HTML `<a>` tag.

This pre-fetches resources providing fast performance. You can [Read more about `<Link>`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/)

an example of using `<Link>` in your blog in an MDX file:

```mdx
---
front matter:
...
---

import {Link} from 'gatsby'

...content

<Link to="/<path>/">an internal page</<Link>

...more content

<a href="www.external.com" alt="an external link">
```

lines 1 -4 are "front matter"  This fields can vary depending  on your theme.

line 6 imports link just like we would in a js file.

line 10 is the internal link.  You can use as many as you need per page
